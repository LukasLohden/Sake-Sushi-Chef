This game is a very simple, bare-bones version of a cooking simulator. There is currently only one customer to feed before the game ends and she always wants a hamburger. The assets for the game were found online at kenny.nl. There are a few remaining bugs in the game, but they donâ€™t prevent the game from being played and won. With some more time the game could have a lot more features and polish. I had some difficulties in the coding and getting everything to work properly.
